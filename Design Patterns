Best practices used for Object Oriented Software developers.

Gang of Four : 1994, 4 developers Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides, published a book, Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software.
 
Principles of Object Oriented Programming :
1. Program to an interface not an implementation.
2. Favor object composition over inheritance.

Usage of design pattern : 
1. Common platform for developers.
2. Best practices.

Types of Design Patterns :
1. Creational Patterns : A way to create object while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator.
2. Structural Patterns : These concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces.
3. Behavioral Patterns : Concerns with communication between objects.
4. J2EE Patterns : These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier.

Design Patterns : 

1. Factory Pattern : focus on creation so creational pattern. 
e.g. Shape interface < Circle class < Shape factory < App
